			MECH 262 is primarily designed to understand experimental results in Mechanical Engineering with the help of statistics and is taught by <a href='https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/people/staff/jovan-nedic'>Prof. Jovan Nedic</a>. It includes Introduction to probability: conditional probability, binomial and Poisson distributions, random variables, laws of large numbers. Statistical analysis associated with measurements; regression and correlation. Basic experimental laboratory techniques, including the measurement of strain, pressure, force, position, and temperature.
