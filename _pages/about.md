Welcome.! I am a PhD student at the [Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Research Lab](https://www.mcgill.ca/mbr/people-1) headed by Dr. Mark Driscoll in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at McGillU. My work mainly focuses on the Biomechanics of Human Spine and it's modeling. As the name suggests, my lab works in various fields ranging from FE Simulations to Benchtop model design to Virtual surgery planning - all revolving around the human spine, it's stability and various medical conditions related to it. 

My research interests include Robot design, Control, Experimental validation. My PhD work is focused on developing a validated robotic benchtop spinal model for use as a research tool in low back research.

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Manipal University](https://manipal.edu/mu.html), India and did my bachelor's thesis with the [R&MM Research Group](http://mech.vub.ac.be/multibody_mechanics.htm) at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium.

I was also a part of [Mars Society South Asia](https://southasia.marssociety.org/) and worked on promoting space exploration and education in the 7 South Asian countries by organizing robotic competitions like [IRC](https://southasia.marssociety.org/indianroverchallenge/), [IRDC](https://southasia.marssociety.org/irdc/) etc.

In my free time, I enjoy doing photography. I love cycling and go on long biking trips during summers.
