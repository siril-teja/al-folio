  title={Implementation of the control system on a robotic spine & Validation of the benchtop model},
  author={Dukkipati, Siril Teja},
  abstract={Spinal cord is one of the major components of the human body which plays a role in the human stability and dexterity. Many studies have been carried out on human and animal cadavers which shines light on the internal mechanisms and spinal response to different load scenarios. But it is trivial that a cadaver cannot be used for everytime. Thus, a benchto model of the spine consisting of ribcage, erector spinae and an abdomen is built. A system like this would be helpful in evaluating parameters like intradiscal pressure (IDP), Intramuscular pressure (IMP), Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the deflection of the spine under different loading scenarios. The robotic spine in this work is named TIM which stands for “Testing of Inflatable Muscles”. The ultimate aim behind this spinal model is to establish a validated benchtop model of the spinal cord with active muscles. The model then can be used for verifying different theories and any finite element analysis results.},

  abstract={This paper presents an underactuated gripper with slip prevention strategy for an unstructured human environment. In such environment the objects are of wide range in terms of size, shape and varying deformable properties. For the gripper to be able to grasp such objects an underactuated mechanism is implemented wherein chebyshev’s lambda mechanism is used for linear motion of the fingers of the gripper. The work in the paper consists of positional analysis of lambda mechanism and underactuated fingers and kinetostatic analysis of the whole gripper. Using appropriately placed sensors and a novel slip prevention strategy the mathematical model of the gripper is used to lift objects with minimal amount of force without damaging them. The results show that the proposed gripper is suitable for unstructured human environments.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
