  abstract={Soft robots have a lot of advantages in terms of human interaction over their rigidcounterparts because of their intrinsic compliance.  These robots can be used to carry out tasksespecially in undefined environments where there is a high chance of unplanned collisions withthe environment.  This can sometimes cause damage to the robots in the form of cuts, abrasionsdue to sharp obstacles in the workspace.  In this work we propose a novel hybrid gripper withrigid  structural  non-healable  components  combined  with  soft  joints  made  out  of  self-healingelastomers.  Diels-Alder polymers are utilized owing to their thermoreversible covalent networksand working temperature range. These polymers have already been proven to be reliable for theirself-healing capability in literature.  Because the joints are made of soft material, the complianceof the gripper itself can be changed.  Both moulding and 3D printing techniques are exploredfor prototyping.  Although the moulding process is comparatively easy, 3D-printing allows forfaster prototyping and the use of multiple materials with different mechanical properties withinthe  same  design.   The  results  show  that  the  proposed  gripper  is  suitable  for  unstructuredenvironments  and  is  compliance  adjustable.   Further,  integration  of  different  sensors  directlyinto the design is probed into.},

  abstract={Robotics and 3D printing are the fast-evolving fields where innovation thrives. More specifically, soft robotics introduces a new bioinspired perspective within the field of robotics. Their inherent compliance gives rise to a wide range of novel applications. The soft material used provides safety for humans who come in contact or share the same environment with the robot. This safety aspect allows a closer connection between robots and humans. This is certainly interesting in the context of robotics. Focusing on rapid prototyping, a soft robotic gripper could ensure safety, comfort and usability among other things. However, bringing soft material in such close contact with humans and the surrounding, makes the robot vulnerable to cuts, scratches, punctures, etc. A prominent solution to this problem is the use of self-healing material. When damage occurs, the material can be triggered to start the self-healing process in the form of a chemical reaction. Research on this material is been excessively done at the department of Physical Chemistry and Polymer Science (FYSC), University of Brussels. This project aims to explore the additive manufacturing possibilities of self-healing material in the form of fused filament fabrication (FFF). While doing so, the idea is to work towards the manufacturing of a soft robotic gripper as a demonstrator. Such a robotic gripper will assist social robots and recreational robots where the robot is at a close proximity to human activity and probable damage causing agents like knives. Additive manufacturing offers freedom of design, more complex designs can be manufactured compared to moulding and shaping by folding and self-healing. Moreover, 3D printing provides a high degree of customization. For example, when manufacturing such a soft robotic gripper, the payload size and shape can be taken into account. Another key element of this project is multi-material printing. Self-healing material can be tailored to have certain properties e.g. a certain stiffness. Combining these materials with different properties can augment the product performance and the users experience, e.g. incorporating more flexibility at the joints of a soft robotic grippers. Also, the stiffness of the joints can be varied for optimal functionality. },

  title={Implementation of the control system on a robotic spine & Validation of the benchtop model},
  author={Dukkipati, Siril Teja},
  abstract={Spinal cord is one of the major components of the human body which plays a role in the human stability and dexterity. Many studies have been carried out on human and animal cadavers which shines light on the internal mechanisms and spinal response to different load scenarios. But it is trivial that a cadaver cannot be used for everytime. Thus, a benchto model of the spine consisting of ribcage, erector spinae and an abdomen is built. A system like this would be helpful in evaluating parameters like intradiscal pressure (IDP), Intramuscular pressure (IMP), Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the deflection of the spine under different loading scenarios. The robotic spine in this work is named TIM which stands for “Testing of Inflatable Muscles”. The ultimate aim behind this spinal model is to establish a validated benchtop model of the spinal cord with active muscles. The model then can be used for verifying different theories and any finite element analysis results.},

  abstract={This paper presents an underactuated gripper with slip prevention strategy for an unstructured human environment. In such environment the objects are of wide range in terms of size, shape and varying deformable properties. For the gripper to be able to grasp such objects an underactuated mechanism is implemented wherein chebyshev’s lambda mechanism is used for linear motion of the fingers of the gripper. The work in the paper consists of positional analysis of lambda mechanism and underactuated fingers and kinetostatic analysis of the whole gripper. Using appropriately placed sensors and a novel slip prevention strategy the mathematical model of the gripper is used to lift objects with minimal amount of force without damaging them. The results show that the proposed gripper is suitable for unstructured human environments.},
