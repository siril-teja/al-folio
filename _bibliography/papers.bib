  abstract={There exists a need for validated lumbar spine models in spine biomechanics research. Although cadaveric testing is the current gold standard for spinal implant development, it poses significant issues related to reliability, repeatability, and ethics. Analogue or synthetic models can act as cost saving alternatives to human tissue. This study presents a first reproducible 3D printable L1-S1 lumbar spine motion segment and validated it in flexion-extension (F-E), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR) in the range of ±15° against in vitro data and in silico models. The model consisted of L1 to S1 vertebrae, corresponding intervertebral discs, intertransverse, interspinous, anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, and facet joints. Displacement controlled pure moments were applied in the range of ±15° in all three bending modes and the resisting moment was recorded. Rotational stiffness was calculated by plotting the resisting moment against rotation. The model reached a maximum of 5.66Nm and 3.53Nm at 15° flexion and rotation, 3.84Nm and 3.93Nm at 15° right and left lateral bending, and 2.45Nm and 2.59Nm at 15° right and left axial rotations respectively. Scaling factors β=1.6 and γ=3.0 were applied in LB and AR to calibrate the model response. Post scaling, the model response in all axes correlated well with in vitro and in silico literature data. An RMS error of 1.57°, 1.64°, 0.82° in F-E, LB and AR respectively was estimated in the model when compared to in vitro human response. The reproduceable 3D printed analogue model described herein can be a valid substitute for cadaveric lumbar motion segments within the explored context of use.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Analogue biomechanical models are powerful tools to further the understanding of human spine. As opposed to cadaveric studies and finite element models these models are time and cost effective. An effort is made to develop an analogue biomechanical model of human thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) and characterize its mechanical properties. METHODS: For such a model to be reliable, high repeatability in model force response and less manufacturing variability is desired. Stereolithography 3D printing is adopted due to these reasons. A 3D model of TLF based on 3D MRI patent data is trimmed from L1 to S1 and is printed on Form 3L (Formlabs Inc, USA) with an elastomer of shore hardness 80A with 10 minutes of post curing. It is then subjected to tensile loading with 10mm longitudinal displacement at 0.5mm/sec while the model is anchored throughout the iliac arch by a custom jig. Resisting force and displacement data above 50% deformation is curve fitted to linear regression and the slope is adopted as model stiffness. Mechanical hysteresis for the soft tissue is estimated according to [1]. Force-time graph is also plotted to characterize stress relaxation in the model. RESULTS: The model displayed viscoelastic properties much like the fascial tissue. Model stiffness is estimated to be 22.2±0.41N/mm. This agrees with 24.1±8.3N/mm range reported for posterior thoracolumbar fascia in [2]. Hysteresis of the model is estimated to be 34.3±0.68% owing its viscoelastic nature. This falls in the range of 24.3±10.1% for posterior fascia lata in longitudinal direction as reported in [3]. This comparison assumes tissue similarities between fascia lata and TLF. Force-time curve at 10mm initial deformation revealed a 40.1±3.0% drop in resisting force after 500sec. This agrees with 43.9% drop during the first stretch of TLF reported by [4]. Excellent model repeatability is observed owing to low standard deviations in results. CONCLUSION: This model of TLF behaves mechanically much like its human counterpart in tension. Further testing is warranted involving loading scenarios such as shear and tear. When coupled with existing lumbar analogue models, it can increase overall model accuracy and can be used as a spinal biomechanics research tool.},

  abstract={Many cadaveric studies and Finite Element (FE) models are used to explore the biomechanics of the lumbar spine and spinal stability in the past and yet the pathomechanisms of many low back related diseases are not fully understood. Cadaveric studies often involve assumptions pertaining to patient’s previous medical history [1]. FE studies on the other hand are not modeled to the extent of human complexity to optimize the solution time. These shortcomings may be addressed by having a valid benchtop spinal testing platform with integrated soft tissues and sensors. Thus, this study aims to develop and validate a fully 3D printed lumbar spine benchtop model for use in an analogous robotic spine model. Such a model would complement existing methods of in-vivo and in-silico studies related to spinal stability and low back pain. The vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs (IVD) and ligaments are manufactured using stereolithography 3D printing. Their geometry is based on 3D MRI patient data, while the ligament geometry is adjusted to incorporate mounting points on the vertebral bodies. Elastomers of shore hardness 50A and 80A are used to manufacture IVDs and ligaments. Three disc designs as well as three combinations of disc and ligament material choices are tested and their rotational stiffness and intradiscal pressure during flexion-extension motion is recorded. Five cycles of ±10 degree rotational displacement at 0.5 deg/sec is applied and the average resisting moment is recorded for rotational stiffness. Force resistive sensors embedded inside the discs measure the intradiscal pressure (IDP) during the experiment. The setup is compared to similar benchtop [2] and FE models [3] reported in literature, and it is found that the 3D printed models extension zone (EZ) stiffness is 0.55±0.19 Nm/deg and is approximately four times less stiff than the human disc. When appropriate scaling factors are applied, the values fall inside ±1 standard deviation corridors of human disc in rotational stiffness across ±10 degree range. Model IDP is recorded to increase at a rate of 0.07MPa/deg across ±10 degree range and also fall inside ±1 standard deviation corridors at two times scaling when compared to the FE model reported in [3]. This fully 3D printed lumbar spine model is validated, with relative scaling, for rotational stiffness and IDP during flexion-extension of ±10 degree range and such a platform can be used to simulate different patient specific loading scenarios to test spinal stability.},

  abstract={Soft robots have a lot of advantages in terms of human interaction over their rigidcounterparts because of their intrinsic compliance.  These robots can be used to carry out tasksespecially in undefined environments where there is a high chance of unplanned collisions withthe environment.  This can sometimes cause damage to the robots in the form of cuts, abrasionsdue to sharp obstacles in the workspace.  In this work we propose a novel hybrid gripper withrigid  structural  non-healable  components  combined  with  soft  joints  made  out  of  self-healingelastomers.  Diels-Alder polymers are utilized owing to their thermoreversible covalent networksand working temperature range. These polymers have already been proven to be reliable for theirself-healing capability in literature.  Because the joints are made of soft material, the complianceof the gripper itself can be changed.  Both moulding and 3D printing techniques are exploredfor prototyping.  Although the moulding process is comparatively easy, 3D-printing allows forfaster prototyping and the use of multiple materials with different mechanical properties withinthe  same  design.   The  results  show  that  the  proposed  gripper  is  suitable  for  unstructuredenvironments  and  is  compliance  adjustable.   Further,  integration  of  different  sensors  directlyinto the design is probed into.},

  abstract={Robotics and 3D printing are the fast-evolving fields where innovation thrives. More specifically, soft robotics introduces a new bioinspired perspective within the field of robotics. Their inherent compliance gives rise to a wide range of novel applications. The soft material used provides safety for humans who come in contact or share the same environment with the robot. This safety aspect allows a closer connection between robots and humans. This is certainly interesting in the context of robotics. Focusing on rapid prototyping, a soft robotic gripper could ensure safety, comfort and usability among other things. However, bringing soft material in such close contact with humans and the surrounding, makes the robot vulnerable to cuts, scratches, punctures, etc. A prominent solution to this problem is the use of self-healing material. When damage occurs, the material can be triggered to start the self-healing process in the form of a chemical reaction. Research on this material is been excessively done at the department of Physical Chemistry and Polymer Science (FYSC), University of Brussels. This project aims to explore the additive manufacturing possibilities of self-healing material in the form of fused filament fabrication (FFF). While doing so, the idea is to work towards the manufacturing of a soft robotic gripper as a demonstrator. Such a robotic gripper will assist social robots and recreational robots where the robot is at a close proximity to human activity and probable damage causing agents like knives. Additive manufacturing offers freedom of design, more complex designs can be manufactured compared to moulding and shaping by folding and self-healing. Moreover, 3D printing provides a high degree of customization. For example, when manufacturing such a soft robotic gripper, the payload size and shape can be taken into account. Another key element of this project is multi-material printing. Self-healing material can be tailored to have certain properties e.g. a certain stiffness. Combining these materials with different properties can augment the product performance and the users experience, e.g. incorporating more flexibility at the joints of a soft robotic grippers. Also, the stiffness of the joints can be varied for optimal functionality. },

  title={Implementation of the control system on a robotic spine & Validation of the benchtop model},
  author={Dukkipati, Siril Teja},
  abstract={Spinal cord is one of the major components of the human body which plays a role in the human stability and dexterity. Many studies have been carried out on human and animal cadavers which shines light on the internal mechanisms and spinal response to different load scenarios. But it is trivial that a cadaver cannot be used for everytime. Thus, a benchto model of the spine consisting of ribcage, erector spinae and an abdomen is built. A system like this would be helpful in evaluating parameters like intradiscal pressure (IDP), Intramuscular pressure (IMP), Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the deflection of the spine under different loading scenarios. The robotic spine in this work is named TIM which stands for “Testing of Inflatable Muscles”. The ultimate aim behind this spinal model is to establish a validated benchtop model of the spinal cord with active muscles. The model then can be used for verifying different theories and any finite element analysis results.},
